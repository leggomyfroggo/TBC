# Overview
These are the gerbers and iBOM for a CPU E version of the Tad Boy Color PCB, adapted by Natalie the Nerd. Compatible with the rest of the TBC components.

Natalie has built and tested this board herself to ensure functionality. Nonetheless, consider this experimental, and **not supported by either of us**.

Give Natalie your monies because she's awesome: [Natalie the Nerd on ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/nataliethenerd).
